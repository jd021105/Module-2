# Exp.No:2(a) ITERATIVE STATEMENTS- PRINTING DIVISIBLE BY 11 NUMBERS

# AIM
To create a print numbers range from M to N (including M and N values) divisible by 11 in reverse order.

# ALGORITHM
1.Start

2.Read integer a from the user.

3.Read integer b from the user.

4.Loop from i = b down to a (inclusive):

5.Use a for loop: for i in range(b, a - 1, -1)

6.Check if the current number i is divisible by 11:

7.If i % 11 == 0, then:

8.Print i

9.End
